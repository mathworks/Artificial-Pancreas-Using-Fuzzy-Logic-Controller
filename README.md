# Artificial Pancreas Using Fuzzy Logic Controller

This example shows how to design and optimize a fuzzy inference system (FIS) tree to control an artificial pancreas. The artificial pancreas regulates the blood glucose level of an individual with type 1 diabetes using subcutaneous infusion of insulin. Type 1 diabetes is a widespread health problem that occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. To regulate the blood glucose levels, the fuzzy system uses a FIS tree, which is a distributed, connected representation of multiple FISs, each with a small rule base. A FIS tree provides easier understanding of the inference process and allows faster performance optimization with a small number of tunable parameters.
